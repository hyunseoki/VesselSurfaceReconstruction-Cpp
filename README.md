# Vessel_Surface_Reconstruction-C
Blood vessel surface reconstruction from vessel center skeleton using VTK

I used vtk8.1 and customized vtk add-on library made by Romer
Please refer the following post in vtk forum : https://discourse.vtk.org/t/mesh-flaw-occurs-when-using-vtkbooleanoperation/1502

You may need to build Romer's vtk add-on libary
At now, it seems that vtk employ Romer's function as their basic function. You may check it and can use newly released vtk version
